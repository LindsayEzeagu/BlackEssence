# BlackEssence

Black Essence is a hair and beauty booking platform connecting professionals with customers.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
It is important that while small businesses may depend highly on social media platforms to book clients, the harsh reality is that if any of these platforms were to crash at any point many businesses would be disconnected from their customers and followers on that social media platform. We saw an example of this in October when Instagram, Facebook & WhatsApp crashed for a while which led to many businesses losing money.

What problem is this booking platform solving?
hair and beauty professionals can reach potential clients who may not use social media platforms like Instagram.
People who are visiting the UK on holiday will find it easier to find hair and beauty services.
